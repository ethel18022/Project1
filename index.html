            <h1>MERCY ETHEL</h1>
            <p id="#p01">My name is Mercy.I am 18 years old.I was born and raised in kenya.I am the lastborn in a family of seven children.I enjoy reading and learning more about the various human dynamics as well as poetry.I believe in dreaming and achieving various goals.I am interested in human psychology and the way the human brain works.Technology has been evolving so much of late and the current trends especially on artificial intelligence as well as robotics also intrigue my mind.</p>
            <h2> Thoughts</h2>
            <p id="#p02"><I>Writing about myself is not my forte cause it feels weird.I'd say that very many things are overrated in this life and generation and in my next life maybe I would  want to be cactus.Currently being a human being has proven to be hard  from living to pleasing people to not knowing what one wants. Social dynamics have proven to be hard especially when it's people you know you'd think you're strong until one day you realise maybe not.One thing about cacti they can survive anywhere and need no attention and even no water and they do survive.Covered by thorns, they get to protect themselves from predators and that's just amazing if you ask me.</I> That being said I'd always advice a human being to seek happiness from within because without is just without...</p>
            <h3>LIFE</h3>
            <img src="rose%20flower.avif"alt="Flower"width="200" height="200"></img>
             <p id="#p03"> Through reading books,watching documentaries and reasearching online, I've come to understand that people express themselves in different  ways and everyone seeks personal growth and self-improvement.Like a rose everyone is unique changes the mood somewhere and often needs attention and care to improve themself.Exposure to sunlight and water makes flowers bloom and the opposite destroys the flowers.Human beings also tend to function in the same way where they get to give feedback depending on the environmeny.Being kind and accomodative is key to ensuring other human beings get to  be their best around us and we get to experience life to the fullest.</p>
             <h4><b> Education</b></h4>
             <p id="#p05">So  far education has not been my favourite part of life.I wonder at times if it's worth the effort having to learn things from basic language to complex mathematics especially things like history that may never apply so much in my life. I have been studying for the past 15 years and determining what next for the next 4 years has proven to be very difficult.In this country if you aren't a doctor you are an engineer or a lawyer even better an architect.Not like i'm talented or anything but i pity all those who aren't given a chance by the society just because they major in arts or things they're passionate about.The chance was not given the opportunity did not avail itself and if it did someone was busy thinking about what people would say and I'd say that's where people go wrong.But I wouldn't know how it would feel becauseoops I am not talented in any way.I've grown up to see very many elite people make the worst decisions and i might as well conclude that sometimes maybe education isn't the key to life. thw 8-4-4 system has taught us to behave in a certain way especially think the same way.At the end of the day, maybe we are the fools and it might never change if we don't choose to. </p>
